**Q: I hope you can help me to get a better understanding of this feedback loop**

A: To deal with the concept of feedback loop, I have the following questions would like to ask you:

- In the article cybernetics one that I asked the class to read as part of this week mini ex, can you describe some of the characteristics of cybernetics? In what way we may understand it through logics? 
- The article also discusses a fire control system, can you tell me what is that about? How can it helps to control informations? 
- Nicolas Schöffer is one of the key persons in the field of cybernetics, can you look for more information to describe one of his works? (for example his early work CYSP 1)
- To extend the concept of feedback loop from system/maths, can you observe what other kinds of software/platforms are having the concept of feedback/loop in your everyday life? 
- Then go to the link that I have given (with many students' work example - http://www.creativeapplications.net/processing/feedback-machines-mis-using-technology-non-linear-behavioural-systems/), what are the common characteristics of all the works? what’s the logic of the work? (although most of the works are responded to external stimulus to obtain data, you may also consider about the input with other materials that you have learn in our last class, such as video/audio/key or mouse press?)


**Q: I'm not sure I understand the last question: How may we use programming to reflect and inquire digital (visual) culture?**

A: In general, how may you think about using programming (the practice part – the actual coding, planning and thinking) as a means of inquiry on border cultural issues (such as a throbber or imagine other digital (visual) culture).

**Q: How to resize an image?**

A: You can try to use image function, see here: https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5/image
I also find a pretty good site in explaining the transformation: http://genekogan.com/code/p5js-transformations/

**Q: Which editor you use? Can I use mine?**

A: For my personal interest I use TextWrangler. Feel free to use any other editor that does the job. (P5.js editor is deprecated but you can still use it for free)

**Q: What language are we meant to speak in at the exam?**

A: English

**Q: The program we should write code in, that you linked to seems to be another program than "processing" (wich they use in the oding train video-series on YouTube you recommended)? Is there a reason for this or am I just confused for no reason?**

A: Daniel Shiffman teaches both Processing and P5.js. They are pretty similar but P5.js supports better web-based application. We are using P5.js but not processing in AP course, however you can also gain some of the fundamental programming concepts from Daniel Shiffman's book "Learning Processing" (I have put in the reference list).
