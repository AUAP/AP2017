**Q: I'm not sure I understand the last question: How may we use programming to reflect and inquire digital (visual) culture?**

A: In general, how may you think about using programming (the practice part â€“ the actual coding, planning and thinking) as a means of inquiry on border cultural issues (such as a throbber or imagine for other digital (visual) culture).

**Q: How to resize an image?**

A: You can try to use image function, see here: https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5/image
I also find a pretty good site in explaining the transformation: http://genekogan.com/code/p5js-transformations/

**Q: Which editor you use? Can I use mine?**

A: For my personal interest I use TextWrangler. Feel free to use any other editor that does the job. (P5.js editor is deprecated but you can still use it for free)

**Q: What language are we meant to speak in at the exam?**

A: English

**Q: The program we should write code in, that you linked to seems to be another program than "processing" (wich they use in the oding train video-series on YouTube you recommended)? Is there a reason for this or am I just confused for no reason?**

A: Daniel Shiffman teaches both Processing and P5.js. They are pretty similar but P5.js supports better web-based application. We are using P5.js but not processing in AP course, however you can also gain some of the fundamental programming concepts from Daniel Shiffman's book "Learning Processing" (I have put in the reference list).
