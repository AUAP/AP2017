# Weekly mini ex9: due week 15 - Working with APIs

1) First, take a deep breath. This mini exercise may require sometimes to do it. If you like you can work in a group of 2 people.

2) Design a program that utilizes a web API (below is just a suggestion, and you can search for others). You need to pay attention to your process of acquiring, processing, using and representing data.

  - [Open Weather](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecT42O6I_WI)
  - [Other weather API by apix](https://p5js.org/examples/hello-p5-weather.html)
  - [New York times](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMne3LY4bks&list=PLRqwX-V7Uu6a-SQiI4RtIwuOrLJGnel0r&index=9)
  - [Giphy images](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mj8_w11MvH8&index=10&list=PLRqwX-V7Uu6a-SQiI4RtIwuOrLJGnel0r)
  - [Twitter API and Twitter Bot](http://shiffman.net/a2z/twitter-bots/)
  - [Movie API](https://itp.nyu.edu/classes/cc-s16/movie-api-data/)
  - [Global statistic API](https://itp.nyu.edu/classes/cc-s16/inqubu-global-statistics-api/)
  - [Google map API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/)
  - [Search many other kinds of API](https://www.programmableweb.com/)
  
>> for those APIs require OAuth, you need [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/). See what is Node [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF5_MPSNAtU&index=1&list=PLRqwX-V7Uu6atTSxoRiVnSuOn6JHnq2yV) for 15.1 and 15.2

3) Upload your sketch in a directory called "miniex9". Create a README file and upload to the same directory. The readme file should address the following: 
- Which API have you chosen? and Why? 
- Please indicate if your work requires to download and run on our own computer. (As for mine, github doesn't work for me that's why I have to upload to my own server and ask you to download it to run on your computer)
- Can you describe your process of making this mini exercise in terms of acquiring, processing, using and representing data?
- What is your reflection on the aesthetics of (big) data? 

4)	Provide peer-feedback to 2 of your classmates on their works. Write with the issue title "Feedback on mini_ex(?) by (YOUR FULL NAME)".
