# Weekly mini ex9: due week 15 - Working with APIs

1) First, take a deep breath. This mini exercise may require sometimes to do it. If you like you can work in a group of 2 people.

2) Read 'The seven stages of Visualizing data' by Ben Fry - check blackboard

3) Design a program that utilizes a web API (below is just a suggestion, and you can search for others). You need to consider the process that Fry has mentioned: acquire, parse, filter, mine and represent. (I leave out the last two stages as it may be too much for a weekly mini ex)

  - (Twitter API and Twitter Bot)[http://shiffman.net/a2z/twitter-bots/]
  - (Movie API)[https://itp.nyu.edu/classes/cc-s16/movie-api-data/]
  - (Global statistic API)[https://itp.nyu.edu/classes/cc-s16/inqubu-global-statistics-api/]
  - (Search many other kinds of API)[https://www.programmableweb.com/]

3) Upload your sketch in a directory called "miniex9. Create a README file and upload to the same directory. The readme file should address the following: 
- Which API have you choosed?
- Can you describe your process of this mini exercise using Fry's visualization stages? (acquire, parse, filter, mine and represent)
- How do you see the aesthetics of (big) data? 

4)	Provide peer-feedback to 2 of your classmates on their works. Write with the issue title "Feedback on mini_ex(?) by (YOUR FULL NAME)".
