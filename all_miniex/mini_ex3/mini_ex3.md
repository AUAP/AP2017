#Weekly mini ex3: due week 9 - Design your own throbber

1) Download the book and read the article: [Executing Micro-temporality (2017) by Winnie Soon, p. 89-102] (http://www.data-browser.net/06/). 

2) Study the syntaxes that have been discussed in class, and then experiment with a new syntax in p5.js that is related to shape/image (https://p5js.org/reference/).

3) Re-design an animated throbber, and then upload to Github.

4) Create a readme file and upload to the same mini_ex3 directory. The readme file should address the followings:

- Describe a bit about your throbber design (your concept and execution)
- How may we use programming to reflect and inquiry digital (visual) culture?

5) Provide peer-feedback to 2 of your classmates on their works by creating "issues" in his/her github corresponding repository.
