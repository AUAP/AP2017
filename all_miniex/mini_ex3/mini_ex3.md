***Weekly mini ex3: due week 9 - Design your own throbber***

1) Download the book and read the article: [Executing Micro-temporality (2017) by Winnie Soon, p. 89-102] (http://www.data-browser.net/06/). 

2) Study the syntaxes that have been discussed in class, and then experiment with a new syntax in p5.js that are related to shape/image (https://p5js.org/reference/).

3) Re-design an animated throbber, and then upload to Github.

4) What is a throbber? How would you describe a throbber? How may we use programming to reflect on digital (visual) culture?

5) Provide peer-feedback to 2 of your classmates on their works by creating "issues" in his/her github corresponding repository.
