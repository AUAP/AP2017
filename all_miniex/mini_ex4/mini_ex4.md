#Weekly mini ex4: due week 10 - Feedback loop

1)	Read the article [Cybernetics and the Pioneers of Computer Art by Thomas Dreher] (http://dreher.netzliteratur.net/4_Medienkunst_Kybernetike.html)

2)	Read some projects that express the concept of feedback loop [here] (http://www.creativeapplications.net/processing/feedback-machines-mis-using-technology-non-linear-behavioural-systems
) 

3)	Explore different sensing technologies such as video, sound, mouse and keyboard 
a.	May be useful – learn how to include other library: https://github.com/processing/p5.js/wiki/Integrating-other-libraries 
b.	Sound: https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5.SoundFile
c.	Video with p5.dom library: https://p5js.org/examples/dom-video-capture.html and https://p5js.org/examples/dom-video.html 
*The above a-c are just recommendation. Feel free to explore and experiment other functions and libraries.

4)	Design a sketch that demonstrates the control of information through feedback and loop, expressing Dreher’s notion of information aesthetics. Upload the final sketch to Github under a folder called "mini_ex4".

5) Create a readme file (README.md) and upload to the same mini_ex4 directory. The readme file should address the followings:

- The title of your work
- A Short description of your work

6) Provide peer-feedback to 2 of your classmates on their works by creating "issues" in his/her github corresponding repository. Write with the issue title "Feedback on mini_ex(?) by (YOUR FULL NAME)"3) Re-design an animated throbber, and then upload to Github under a folder called mini_ex3.
