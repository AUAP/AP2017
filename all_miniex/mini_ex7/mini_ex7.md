4) Upload your final sketch to Github under a directory called "mini_ex7"
4) Create a readme file and upload to the same mini_ex6 directory. The readme file should address the followings:
- Give a title to your piece and describe your program with a screenshot.
- What are the rules that you have employed in your program?
- By using some of the concepts from the article - Generative Art Theory, can you discuss how is your program expressed the notion of generativity? (such as authorship/nonhuman creation/autonomous system/Complexity/Emergent behaviour etc) 

5) Try to use the vocabulary within the article “Generative Art Theory” to provide peer-feedback to 2 of your classmates on their works. Write with the issue title "Feedback on mini_ex(?) by (YOUR FULL NAME)"





4)	This mini exercise addresses objects in two ways: 1/ the general notion of object in object-oriented programming language 2/ HTML5 objects in p5.dom. What are the advantages in using objects and what might be the limitations? 

5)	Provide peer-feedback to 2 of your classmates on their works.
