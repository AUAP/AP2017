#Weekly mini ex6: due week 12 - A Generative Program

1) Read the article again "Generative Art Theory by Philip Galanter" - check the reading on blackboard

2) Design a generative program with at least 3 basic rules to allow your program to unfold and emerge over time.

3) Upload your final sketch to Github under a directory called "mini_ex6".

4) Create a readme file and upload to the same mini_ex6 directory. The readme file should address the followings:
- Give a title to your piece and describe your program with a screenshot.
- What constitutes generativity?
- What is the aesthetics of generativity? 

5) Try to use the vocabulary within the article “Generative Art Theory” to provide peer-feedback to 2 of your classmates on their works in relation to complexity/systems/generativity. 
Write with the issue title "Feedback on mini_ex(?) by (YOUR FULL NAME)"
