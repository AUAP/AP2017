#Weekly mini ex2: due week 8 - My First Program

1) Watch the assigned class materials and create a github account

2) Design and write your first program with p5.js within 15 lines of code without errors. Upload the program/result to your Github account under the folder mini_ex2. (Make sure your program can be run on a web browser - Github account)

3) Create a readme file and upload to the same mini_ex2 directory. The readme file should address the followings:
  
  - A screen shot about your program (see [this] (http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10189356/how-to-add-screenshot-to-readmes-in-github-repository)).
  - Describe your coding process 
  - What constitutes a program?
