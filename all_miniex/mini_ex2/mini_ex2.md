#Weekly mini ex2: due week 8 - My First Program

1) Watch the assigned class materials and create a github account

2) Design a cartoon character/graphic that expresses noises/glitches/errors. Write your first program with p5.js without errors. Upload the program/result to your Github account under a folder called mini_ex2. (Make sure your program can be run on a web browser - Github account example: [https://auap.github.io/AP2017/class02/sketch01/] (https://auap.github.io/AP2017/class02/sketch01/))

3) Create a readme file (README.md) and upload to the same mini_ex2 directory (see [this] (https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) for editing the README). The readme file should address the followings:
  
  - A screen shot about your program (see [this] (http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10189356/how-to-add-screenshot-to-readmes-in-github-repository)).
  - Describe your coding process 
  - What constitutes a program?
  - Reflect on the notion of error (what is error to you?)
  
4) Read [Error, the Unforeseen, and the Emergent (2007) by Tim Barker] (http://journal.media-culture.org.au/0710/03-barker.php), does it change your understanding of error? 

5) Provide peer-feedback to 2 of your classmates on their works by creating "issues" in his/her github corresponding repository. Write with the issue title "Feedback on mini_ex(?) by (YOUR FULL NAME)"
<br> how to do a peer feedback? Check the slide in class03, we can use the framework of critique i.e describe > analysis > interpretation > Reflection.
