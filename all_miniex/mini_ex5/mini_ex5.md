#Weekly mini ex5: due week 11 - electronic literature

1) Read the article again <Literature from Page to Interface: The Treatments of Text in Christophe Bruno’s Iterature by Søren Pold> http://www.electronicbookreview.com/thread/electropoetics/textualized 

2) Take a look at any one of the Bruno’s projects that has been mentioned in the article

3) Find some found text (spam/lyrics/poems/books), and use them to explore and experiment RiTa library

4) Design an electronic literature using found text and RiTa.js library. Upload your final sketch to Github under a directory called "mini_ex5".

5) Create a readme file and upload to the same mini_ex5 directory. The readme file should address the followings:
- Give a title to your piece and describe your program with a screenshot.
- What kind of functions you have used from RiTa library? 
- Can you describe your experience in working with found text as the source materials? 
- How might we think about the materiality of text/interface? How might we understand the “textual character” of the found text? (see the assigned class reading: https://elmcip.net/critical-writing/aesthetics-materiality-electronic-literature)

6) Provide peer-feedback to 2 of your classmates on their works by creating "issues" in his/her github corresponding repository. Write with the issue title "Feedback on mini_ex(?) by (YOUR FULL NAME)"
