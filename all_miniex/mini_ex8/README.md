# Weekly mini ex8: due week 14 - Coding challenge and a flow chart

1) Select any one of the [coding challenge video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17WoOqgXsRM&list=PLRqwX-V7Uu6ZiZxtDDRCi6uhfTH4FilpH), and follow the tutorial and experiment in p5.js (change some parameters, add or delete things). 

2) You are required to **add a new function/syntax** based on the selected coding challenge. Draw a flow chart of the selected coding challenge together with your new function. Upload your sketch + a flow chart to the directory called "mini_ex8"

3) Create a README file and upload to the same directory. The readme file should address the following: 
- What is your selected coding challenge?
- What function/syntax have you added?
- What is the difficulty of this week mini exercise?  
- How may we see, organize and communicate things differently by using a flow chart?  

4)	Provide peer-feedback to 2 of your classmates on their works. Write with the issue title "Feedback on mini_ex(?) by (YOUR FULL NAME)".
