# Aesthetic Programming 2017 @ Aarhus University 
**Course title:** Aesthetic Programming (20 ECTS), 2017  
**Name:**Winnie Soon (wsoon@cc.au.dk)  
**Time:** Every Tue 0800 – 1100 (3 hours)  
**Location:** 5361-144

##OUTLINE:  
“Aesthetic Programming” is a practice-based course requires no prior programming experience but an interest to explore the relationship between art, design, technology and culture within the context of software studies. The course introduces coding as an aesthetic and critical endeavour beyond its functional application. It explores coding as a practice of thinking with and in the world, and understanding the complex computational procedures that underwrite our experiences and realities in digital culture. Through coding practice, students are able to contextualize, conceptualize, articulate, design and write a piece of software. Emphasis is placed on the student acquiring practical skills of expression through an introduction to programming, and this course uses [P5.js] (https://p5js.org/) primarily, which serves as a foundation for further courses on Digital Design.   
  
The course is designed to complement the parallel course in SOFTWARE STUDIES where further critical work will be developed and expanded but without losing sight of coding as critical work in itself. Examples of artists and designers will be introduced that work with coding as their expressive material.   

##TASKS:   
1. Individual weekly mini exercises + peer feedback 
2. Peer-tutoring: within 20 mins in-class presentation 
3. FINAL group project - in the form of a “readme” and a “runme” (software) packaged + in class presentation 
4. Oral exam (Date: to be confirmed)

##Other learning support environment:
1. Weekly 2 hours tutorial session (every Wed - Mandatory)
2. Weekly 4 hours shut up+code or code study group discussion (every Friday - Optional)

##SKILLS:
1. Provides an introduction to computer programming
2. Design and develops computational artefacts 
3. Integrates practical and theoretical skills
4. Thinking through making (computational thinking)

| **Thinking line:** <br> Think about what you have experienced in childhood and today, such as advertisement and marketing strategies on games/electronic devices and conversations with peers, have you experienced any forms of gender bias? How’s the practice of coding influenced by culture and society? |
