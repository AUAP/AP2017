<h1>Synopsis</h2>

<h3>Our software:</h3> 
Our software aims at expressing the notion of social capital (Grosser, 2014, p.. 2) and its relation to freedom of speech on social media. We would like to explore how social media and especially Facebook supports and sustains already existing social structures of the society. Meaning that we on Facebook found a similarity to the capitalistic concept, where the ones that have more get more.  In this case it’s not regarding the economical aspect, but the social aspect.    
We would also like to explore how the people who to a greater extent uses Facebook, meaning that they click the like buttons more, posts more, add more friends and so on, are favoured by Facebook by giving them, the users, more visibility. Our argument thereby is that the ones who give Facebook more profit (by accumulating social networks or data) are given social profit in return by Facebook.
We would also like to criticize the fact that this quid pro quo framework present on Facebook slips by rather unnoticed by the majority of people. 

We will take our theoretical starting point in the text  ”What Do Metrics Want? How Quantification Prescribes Social Interaction on Facebook” (2014), in Computational Culture no. 4 by Benjamin Grosser. Grosser has with his software artwork Facebook Demetricator (2012) explored the use of metrics on Facebook, and how they affect our behavioural patterns in the social context that Facebook is and specifically how metrics contribute to our desire for more (ibid., p. 1).  By that Grosser uses software to explore a cultural issue or concern as we ourselves wish to do. The above mentioned text is an examination of the metrics of Facebook and Grosser’s own artwork, which is why we find this relevant as a theoretical foundation.
Furthermore we have found inspiration in the episode “Nosedive”(2016) of the tv-series Black Mirror which explicitly expresses how you gain more opportunities not only online, but in life (work, love, economy etc.) by gaining popularity on social networks. The episode can be characterized as dystopian and yet alarmingly close to reality showing how sociality has been materialized and economized through social media such as Facebook. The difference in the Black Mirror episode is that now it is not only the social media companies that gain profit from our popularity but also ourselves. 

<h3>How does it work?</h3>
Our program will make use of aesthetics known from Facebook (such as the like button), but use it in a new context to call attention to what we find criticizable.
Our program is quite simple, but we do not find that a complexity is needed to express our criticism.
It consists of a like button (as known from Facebook) and a character counter. When you press the like button there will be added an exponentially increment to the character counter which illustrates how many characters you can use for posts etc. on social media, thus emphasizing your social capital.

In order to make the notion of the “desire for more” as a fundamental trait of capitalism (ibid., p. 1), the increment on the counter works exponentially in relation to the current quantity of characters available. So if the counter has for instance 162 characters, the increment when liking something/clicking the like button will be +7 characters to the counter while a current count of 207 would be incremented by +18 characters.
 
The more characters on the counter, the higher the increment when pressing the like button. A table of increments could go like this:
 
140 - 159 = +2 characters
160 – 199 = +5+2 characters (+7)
200 – 319 = +11+5+2 characters (+18)
320+           = +24+11+5+2 characters (+42)
 
Limit: No limit (The idea of capitalism is emphasized through “wanting more” meaning that the satisfaction(s) of your needs always is s+1. In regards to this notion, a limit would not be suitable for this program.)

In addition to this exponential incrementation of characters, the character counter decrements every second as to illustrate that being active is important to maintain your social capital.

<h3>How has your work expressed the aesthetic of code/computational structure/computational culture? (You need to refer explicitly to any one of the assigned articles)</h3>

As previously mentioned Benjamin Grosser’s “What Do Metrics Want? How Quantification Prescribes Social Interaction on Facebook” partly forms our theoretical starting point. With both Grosser’s Facebook Demetricator and the above mentioned text in mind it will now be discussed how our work expresses computational culture.
Our work is trying to show that Facebook and the algorithms behind it are not neutral in any way. Computational culture is thereby not just limited to computation but expands further into society and confirms and supports structures found in the society.

The visible metrics on Facebook gives every individual user a kind of personal value through economizing the quantity of likes, friends, comments and so on, while there are non-visible metrics concerning a user’s means of expression through visibility (ibid.). We argue that such metrics can be defined as a sort of social capital or as a means to achieve this. Our software illustrates this through code, graphic visuals and interactivity imitating that of Facebook, only instead of ignoring the visibility of such metric, we illustrate it through the character-counter which increments by the user interacting but simultaneously decrements constantly. These are features stressing the fact that activity is necessary in order to maintain social capital, and also that quantity seemingly matters more than quality within Facebook.
In the Facebook feed, more liked comments, shares and status updates are prioritized as top material. In that way Facebook effectively quantifies and economize this social metric of likes (ibid., p. 2 ff). Our software does not work exactly like this because there is no feed to prioritize, instead we have chosen to illustrate a metric that works similar but in a more direct relation to the like button as explained earlier.

<h3>Open question: How do you see the project as a critical work in itself?</h3>

Our software concerns a non-visible metric of Facebook, a metric that we define as a sort of social capital – one which determines a user’s means of expression. The software aims at exploring this social capital and its relation to a user’s visibility on Facebook. This is done through illustrating this metric which Facebook itself does not make visible. The visibility of the metric itself (the character-counter) thus emphasize the relation between social capital and the means to express yourself on social media.
 
The more capital you have, the more you get. We see this as a democratic problem in terms of social media and freedom of speech – that those who say more and maintain more activity also gains more visibility from their peers. Our software expresses the users’ activity (liking, commenting etc.) converted into visibility with the character-counter, incrementing through user interactions.
 
This means that our main focus has not been on the privacy issue which may not be dismissed, but there have simply been drawn extensive attention to this already and we thought it would be a mimic to try and criticize this once again.

As a starting point the following questions could be asked: 

Who does the system of Facebook work for?
How does it change us and our behavior? (Are we more likely to hit the like button if we know that it will give us more visibility? The design teaches us that more is necessary (p. 5)
What does it make possible?
