Our software aims at expressing the notion of social capital (Grosser, 2014, p.. 2) and its relation to freedom of speech on social media.

We would like to explore how social media and especially Facebook supports and sustains already existing social structures of the society. Meaning that on Facebook we find a similarity to the capitalistic concept, where the ones that have more get more. In this case it’s not regarding the economical aspect, but the social aspect. Social capital is tied with personal worth and prestige in comparison to other people, notably friends. Raising one’s social capital is achieved by raising the numbers on your Facebook profile; your number of friends, likes, comments and so on.

We would also like to explore how the people who to a greater extent uses Facebook, meaning that they click the like buttons more, posts more, add more friends and so on, are favoured by Facebook by giving them, the users, more visibility. Our argument thereby is that the ones who give Facebook more profit (by accumulating social networks or data) are given social profit in return by Facebook:

<i>“This need for high metric performance is further influenced by the workings of Facebook’s News Feed algorithm. The more a user interacts with likes, comments, and other similar objects throughout the site, the more the algorithm favors that user’s posts and thus shows them on the news feeds of their friends.”</i> (Benjamin Grosser, ”What Do Metrics Want? How Quantification Prescribes Social Interaction on Facebook,” 2014)

This quote presents our main argument regarding freedom of speech. As mentioned above, Grosser points out that it is the active Facebook members that gain visibility. Our argument is therefore that freedom of speech is at risk, because activity equals visibility. If your updates are not visible on another person’s news feed due to lack of activity, it affects the worth of the update and your voice on Facebook. Some would argue that this also happens in the real world, which is true, but is not any less of a reason not to criticize the fact that it is happening on the internet as well. The internet is a place that has united the whole world, and made things possible that weren’t possible before. We would thereby argue that this is one of the reasons why we shouldn’t accept it happening.

We would also like to criticize the fact that this quid pro quo framework present on Facebook slips by rather unnoticed by the majority of people, by expressing it throughout our program as a visible metric.

We will take our theoretical starting point in the text  ”What Do Metrics Want? How Quantification Prescribes Social Interaction on Facebook” (2014), in Computational Culture no. 4 by Benjamin Grosser. With his software artwork Facebook Demetricator (2012), Grosser explores the use of metrics on Facebook and how they affect our behavioural patterns in the social context that Facebook is, specifically how metrics contribute to our desire for more (ibid., p. 1).  By that Grosser uses software to explore a cultural issue or concern as we ourselves wish to do. The above mentioned text is an examination of the metrics of Facebook and Grosser’s own artwork, which is why we find this relevant as a theoretical foundation.
Furthermore we have found inspiration in the episode “Nosedive”(2016) of the tv-series Black Mirror which explicitly expresses how you gain more opportunities not only online, but in life (work, love, economy etc.) by gaining popularity on social networks. The episode can be characterized as dystopian and yet alarmingly close to reality showing how sociality has been materialized and economized through social media such as Facebook. The difference in the Black Mirror episode is that now it is not only the social media companies that gain profit from our popularity but also ourselves.

<h3>Visuals and functions</h3>
Our program will make use of aesthetics known from Facebook such as the like button, but use it in a new context to call attention to what we find criticizable. Also it is quite simple, but we do not find that a complexity is needed to express our criticism. Rather, we would argue that the simplicity we have chosen also helps the user to conclude on the program with more ease. That way, what we want to express becomes more direct.

The program consists of a like button, a character counter and a textbox. When you press the like button there will be added an exponential increment to the character counter, which illustrates how many characters you can use for posting, thus emphasizing your social capital.
The amount of characters is also connected to the textbox, which means that you can only use the characters available. It restricts the user, while encouraging and rewarding activity. The finished post will appear on the left side of the screen. It will be visible for 3 seconds + (character count * 10), so that your character count (activity) will have an impact on your visibility.

<h3>Our algorithm - incrementation and decrementation</h3>
In order to make the notion of the “desire for more” as a fundamental trait of capitalism (ibid., p. 1), meanwhile emphasizing the fact that the more you have, the more you are likely to get, the increment on the counter works exponentially in relation to the current quantity of characters on the counter. The algorithm that is called every time a user clicks the like button is formulated like this:

<i>Charactercount = (Charactercount*1.17) + 3</i>

Thus, the counter effectively loops in on itself everytime the user clicks the Like button. The user is then rewarded with more characters that can be used in a post (which is illustrated through the posting option that is limited to not exceed the quantity of characters on the counter). This way we seek to link the notion of a social capital, the one that determines your visibility towards your social network, to the counter represented as a visible metric within our program.
  
Limit: No limit. 
The idea of capitalism is emphasized through “wanting more”, meaning that the satisfaction(s) of your needs are always +1. In regards to this notion, a limit would not be suitable for this program.

In addition to this exponential incrementation of characters, the counter also decrements every second as to illustrate that being active is important to maintain your social capital. Also, the counter decrements faster when a user has more letters, in order to activate the users need of sustaining visibility, even if a high number has been achieved.

<h3>How our work express the aesthetic of code and computational culture</h3>
As previously mentioned Benjamin Grosser’s “What Do Metrics Want? How Quantification Prescribes Social Interaction on Facebook” partly forms our theoretical starting point. With both Grosser’s Facebook Demetricator and the above mentioned text in mind it will now be discussed how our work expresses computational culture.

Our work is trying to show that Facebook and the algorithms behind it are not neutral in any way. Computational culture is thereby not just limited to computation but expands further into society and confirms and supports structures found in the society.

The visible metrics on Facebook gives every individual user a kind of personal value through economizing the quantity of likes, friends, comments and so on, while there are non-visible metrics concerning a user’s means of expression through visibility (ibid.). We argue that such metrics can be defined as a sort of social capital or as a means to achieve this. Our software illustrates this through code, graphic visuals and interactivity imitating that of Facebook, only instead of ignoring the visibility of such metric, we illustrate it through the counter that increments with the user interacting but simultaneously decrements constantly. These are features stressing the fact that activity is necessary in order to maintain social capital, and also that quantity at first seemingly matters more than quality within Facebook.
In the Facebook news feed, more liked comments, shares and status updates are prioritized as top material. In that way Facebook effectively quantifies and economize this social metric of likes (ibid., p. 2 ff). Our software does not exactly work like this because there is no feed to prioritize, instead we have chosen to illustrate a metric that works similar but in a more direct relation to the like button as explained earlier.

<h3>Open question: How do you see the project as a critical work in itself?</h3>
Our software concerns a non-visible metric of Facebook, a metric that we define as a sort of social capital – one which determines a user’s means of expression. The software aims at exploring this social capital and its relation to a user’s visibility on Facebook. This is done through illustrating this metric which Facebook itself does not make visible. The visibility of the metric itself (the character-counter) thus emphasize the relation between social capital and the means to express yourself on social media.
 
The more capital you have, the more you get. We see this as a democratic problem in terms of social media and freedom of speech – that those who say more and maintain more activity also gains more visibility from their peers. Our software expresses the users’ activity (liking) converted into visibility with the character-counter, incrementing through user interactions.

This means that our main focus has not been on the privacy issue which may not be dismissed, but there have simply been drawn extensive attention to this already and we thought it would be a mimic to try and criticize this once again.
