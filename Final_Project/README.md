# Final Project Brief for Aesthetic Programming 2017

## Description:

This course introduces coding as an aesthetic and critical endeavor beyond its functional application. It explores coding as a practice of thinking with and in the world, and understanding the complex computational procedures that underwrite our experiences and realities in digital culture. By drawing upon different theoretical texts from the course Software Studies and Aesthetic Programming, your group is required to produce and design a computational artifact that expresses the aesthetic of code/computational structure/computational culture. The idea should be built/reflect upon any one of the assigned articles in Software Studies/Aesthetic Programming class. In this way, your work should demonstrate the ability to integrate practical and theoretical skills to articulate and develop computational artifacts, examining the aesthetic, cultural, social and political aspects of software.  

To begin with, there are few tips may help you to come up with a project idea: 

1/ You may take a look again on the themes that we have used in our weekly classes for inspiration.  

-	code and practice
-	code and loading (temporality)
-	code and interactivity
-	code and language
-	code and generativity
-	code and objects
-	code and algorithms
-	code and datafication

2/ Take a look again on all the mini exercises and all the questions that were set. Is there any one that you want to explore further?

3/ Is there any assigned text (from both Software Studies and Aesthetic Programming) that you are especially connected with and you want to explore in a deeper way? (Do you particularly/partially agree or disagree on some of the points in the selected article? Why?)

4/ Is there any particular technical area that you want to explore and employ in this project? 

5/ Take a look at previous students’ work: https://vimeo.com/groups/382805 

## Deliverable:

1/ **RUNME:**  A piece of software written in p5.js (or a combination of HTML/CSS/JS/P5.js), and it should be able to execute successfully in a web browser. 
* Remember to include all external libraries and data such as images, font, text file, sound etc. Furthermore, if you have borrowed other sample code, please cite your sources in the code comments. 

2/ **README:** A single word document within 6 pages.  The document includes a title, a screen shot, a flow chart, a synopsis, links to related projects (if there is any).  Regarding the synopsis, it should address at least the following questions:
-	What is your software about (short description: what is it and what do you want to explore)?
-	How does it work?
-	How has your work expressed the aesthetic of code/computational structure/computational culture? (You need to refer explicitly to any one of the assigned articles)
-	Open question: How do you see the project as a critical work in itself?

3/ **Submission via Github:** 
- Submission channel: https://github.com/AUAP/AP2017
- Create a group folder under the existing one-“Final_Project” e.g Group1, Group2 …
- For draft submission: create a draft folder under your group folder
- For final project submission: create a final folder under your group folder, then put all the RUNME and README files inside the final folder.

## Presentation: 

Conduct a presentation within 10 mins with a software demo, articulating your work in both conceptual and technical levels. The presentation will follow by a short Q & A session (within 5 mins). 

* Be selective of your presentation items; present those you think are key to the class
* Make sure you have tested your program in a classroom setting, such as projector, Internet connection, sound, slide, resolution etc. 
* Our internal examiner Marie Louise Juul Søndergaard will be there too.
