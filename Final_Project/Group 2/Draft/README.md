The infrastructure of society has throughout history always been defined by ways in which information and goods has been transmitted across time and space. Throughout most of our history this infrastructure has been largely reliant on the trade-networks of roads; as an example of this was how the silk-road meant the trade of foreign goods and information across national and cultural borders. Some of the most powerful people were the ones that controlled or owned parts of these trade networks, and thus had direct power to the information that made possible the altering of such networks.
The same concept was further developed along with the industrial revolution and the invention of railroads; the concept of a network distributing information was the same, and again we saw that the people of power, most likely were the ones who had (at least to some degree) access to change and manage how the railroads were managed.
With the coming of the 21st century a new and revolutionary way of managing our cultural and societal infrastructures was discovered: The internet.
As with the ancient trade-networks as well as the railroads of the 19th and 20th century (and arguably still to this day), the people who has access to the large centralized hubs of data on the modern client-server based web 2.0, also has the power to alter the infrastructure of how information is shared which exhibits a potential danger because giving this power to “the few” can’t possibly help improve the infrastructure for the best of all people, because “the few” will only know what is best for “the few” and not what is best for the common good. In his work “From open source to open government: A critique of open politics” by Nathanial Tkacz he explores open distribution of the knowledge necessary to alter the infrastructures of society. By comparing both the fascistic and communistic regimes of the 20th century to Plato’s State, he argues that all of these are examples of how power becomes centralized in the hands of the few, when the knowledge of how to alter the infrastructure becomes centralized as well, thus depriving the opportunity for the common man to have a saying in how a given society is constructed <i>(Tkacz 2012  ,pp. 187-189)</i> He further explores how this can be solved by implementing an open, collaborative government: A government that openly shares the knowledge of the infrastructure and how to alter it, as well as collaboratively construct the mechanics governing that infrastructure <i>(Tkacz, 2012)</i>.

With this work, which we have named “The Great Leader”, we want to show an example of how the rising centralization that the client-server based internet has brought onto the infrastructure of modern society, holds the danger that the usage and distribution of information can be changed to the advantage of those controlling these centralized hubs.
The program uses API-data from what can be commonly considered as “negative” data (i.e. death- and crime-rates, carbon emissions etc.) and transform it into a positive spinned sentences posted on Twitter using a twitter-bot module coded in JavaScript.

If a twitter user replies to a post with the hashtag specified at the bottom of the statement, the they will receive a picture of the real API-data.

 If fifty percent or more of the followers of the Twitter-bot write the hashtag in a tweet to the bot, the Twitter-bot posts the picture of the real API-data on it’s own public wall. This shows what the positively-spinned post is based upon, thus revealing some of the implications the production-mechanism behind the statement of “The Great Leader” as an infrastructure of information.

Thus drawing on the notions of Walter Benjamin’s theories of knowing the production mechanisms behind any given instrument for sharing information (Benjamin, 1936), and Tkacz’s notions of open government and collaboration <i>(Tkacz, 2012)</i>, the followers of the twitter-bot account (referred to “the citizens of the great nation” by the Twitter-bot) can collaboratively reveal the source data from which the spinned text is based upon. Further elaborating on Walter Benjamin, we encourage critical thinking and understanding of the production mechanism, that people use. This is represented in the spin of information and people needing to know the implications of the infrastructures they engage in for information-acquisition <i>(Benjamin 1936)</i>.
Aforementioned concepts are in this way represented in The Great Leader both through the software aspect inherent in the program, and the governmental aspect conceptualized through the idea of The Great Leader as a fictional government. Both aspects share several similarities and notions represented in different ways. 
The governmental approach is related to the different mentions of either ’closed’ or ’open’ governments in ”From Open source to Open Government”, where Plato’s closed society (as described in his work The Republic), is countered by liberalist Popper, who proposes an ’open’ government <i>(Tkacz, 2012)</i>.

Some of the aspects of an open government, as explained by Tkacz, include openness, information, collaboration, transparency and participation (dubbed government 2.0). Especially collaboration, transparency, and in continuation of this access to information, are some of the notions we chose to explore through the raw API data (information) being ’spun’ in the production process of the bot and the potential for ’citizens’ to seek the source (transparency) and publicize this (collaboration). 
We specifically criticize the fictional and closed ’government’ and infrastructure inherent in it. The Twitter-bot is in itself a parody of a great leader and the apparent totalitarian system in which it rules; and especially the lack of transparency is a major critique point. The fact that the ’citizens’ have to actively engage with The Great Leader to seek the source and ’open’ the supposed society they live in (meaning the fictive government and therefore also society they live in), encompass the notion of collaboration, that Nathanial Tkacz refers to in the text mentioned earlier. It is important to mention that the concepts of ’openness’ and ’closure’ are not fixed definitions, but are fluent concepts to describe fluctuating elements for discussion. Nor are one or the other defined as better than the other. 
Concludingly this project explores openness and exhibits a critique of the apparent lack of transparency in the infrastructural setup of the client-server based web 2.0. Therefore it is important to know the implications of using these productions mechanism. We raise questions as to how we interact on the internet, and how this interaction (or lack thereof) reflects on the notion of open-government and open-source sharing of knowledge and infrastructure as well as source-criticism.
The goal of this work is to shed light on the importance to be critical towards the underlying  infrastructures of software on the internet.
